## 🎯 Pitch Angles for ViralVibe
When reaching out, emphasize these three intersections:
1.  **Democratization**: "We bring professional AI editing power to the phone/browser for Gen Z."
2.  **Expression**: "We are the canvas for the next wave of viral content."
3.  **Monetization**: "We help creators produce higher quality content faster, leading to better earnings."

## 🚀 Recommended Outreach Strategy

**Start Here (The "Momentum" Phase):**
Contact **Angel Investors** and **specialized Micro-VCs** first. They move faster, understand the niche, and can provide the "signal" needed to attract bigger funds later.

1.  **Meagan Loyst (Gen Z VCs):** *Top Priority.* Your product is perfectly aligned with her thesis. If you get her attention, it validates you for everyone else.
2.  **Li Jin (Atelier):** The "Patron Saint" of the Creator Economy. Even if she passes, her feedback is gold.
3.  **Hugo Amsellem:** Very accessible and deeply embedded in the community.

**Next Steps (The "Growth" Phase):**
Once you have an Angel committed or strong user metrics, go to **Tier 1 VCs**:
1.  **SignalFire:** Their data-driven approach means if your growth metrics are good, they will be interested.
2.  **a16z (Consumer Team):** The ultimate goal, but hard to crack without a "warm intro" or buzzing traction.

**Why this order?**
Getting a "Yes" from a respected Angel (like Meagan or Li) creates "FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out) for the larger VC firms.

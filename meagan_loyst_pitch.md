# 🚀 Pitch Strategy: Meagan Loyst (Gen Z VCs)

**Goal:** Secure a meeting or "green signal" (endorsement/interest).

## 🔑 Key "Unlock" Themes for Meagan
Based on her investment thesis and public talks, hit these 4 points hard:

1.  **"Gen Z as Creators, Not Just Consumers":**
    *   *The Angle:* ViralVibe isn't just an editor; it's a tool that empowers the "Creator Class" to build businesses, not just watch videos.
    *   *Buzzwords to use:* "Community-led growth," "Democratization of production," "The next layer of the Creator Economy stack."

2.  **"Scrappy & Fast":**
    *   *The Angle:* She loves founders who build fast with limited resources. Mention you built this professional-grade tool largely solo (or with a small team) rapidly.
    *   *Proof:* "I built a Canva-like rendering engine in the browser..."

3.  **Community Potential:**
    *   *The Angle:* It's not just a tool; it's a future network. (e.g., "We are building the 'GitHub for Creators' where people share templates, not just code.")

4.  **Clarity & Passion:**
    *   *The Angle:* Don't be corporate. Be authentic, energetic, and extremely clear about the problem.

## 📧 Cold Outreach Drafts

### Option 1: The "Product-First" Approach (Twitter DM / Email)
**Subject:** Building the "Canva for Gen Z Video" – would love your eyes on this

Hi Meagan,

I’ve been following Gen Z VCs since [Year/Event], and your take on [Specific Topic, e.g., "Gen Z as builders"] really resonated with me.

I'm building **ViralVibe** – a professional browser-based video editor designed specifically for the next wave of Gen Z creators.

**Why this matters now:**
*   Traditional editors (Premiere) are too hard; mobile apps (CapCut) are too limiting.
*   We brought the power of desktop editing to the browser with a custom rendering engine.
*   **Traction:** [Insert 1 impressive metric if you have it, e.g., "Built MVP in 3 weeks," "50 beta users," etc. If none, say "MVP is live and shipping updates daily."]

I'm not asking for a check yet. I'd just love 5 minutes of your feedback because you understand this user behavior better than anyone.

### Option 2: The "Community" Angle
**Subject:** Empowering the next 10M creators (ViralVibe)

Hi Meagan,

You’ve often said that Gen Z are natural entrepreneurs. I’m building the tool stack to empower them.

**ViralVibe** is an AI-powered media editor that lowers the barrier to entry for high-quality content creation. We aren't just building a tool; we're building the infrastructure for the next generation of creative businesses.

We are currently [Pre-seed/Bootstrapped] and moving fast.

Would you be open to a quick coffee chat (or Zoom) to discuss the future of creator tools? Your insight would be invaluable as we refine our roadmap.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## �💡 "Anti-Portfolio" (What to AVOID)
*   **Don't be vague.** "We are disrupting video." -> **BAD.**
*   **Don't act like "Old Corp."** Avoid stiff, formal language. Be human.
*   **Don't ask for "money" immediately.** Ask for *advice* or *feedback*. If she likes the product, the money conversation will follow naturally.
